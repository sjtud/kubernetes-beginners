## Something about docker

[Basics â€“ Docker, Containers, Hypervisors, CoreOS](http://etherealmind.com/basics-docker-containers-hypervisors-coreos/) is a good way to know what docker is.

After that, you can read [docker-jumpstart#introduction](https://github.com/odewahn/docker-jumpstart/blob/master/public/introduction.md) to know some concept about docker.

Then you should install the docker, and try it. If you are a OS X user, follow [https://docs.docker.com/mac/](https://docs.docker.com/mac/), else if you are a Linux user, follow [https://docs.docker.com/linux/](https://docs.docker.com/linux/), else follow [https://docs.docker.com/windows/](https://docs.docker.com/windows/)

enh, if you are in OS X or Windows, you may need to know something about [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/). Because now docker is actually only running in Linux, so the docker-machine is the solution to use docker in non-Linux. Fortunately, when you follow the steps to install docker in OS X or Windows, docker-machine will be installed with docker. **So you don't need to care about the docker-machine if you don't have a problem.**
## Something about k8s

[k8s user guide](http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/user-guide/) and [k8s community resources](http://k8s.info/) is enough, I think.
